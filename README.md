## Details:

### Minimal Interface

OneLiners are known to be minimal. Instead of 3 different stacked toolbars, you have everything in a single, continuous bar. With only the **Refresh** and **Home** Button available on Startpage, buttons appear and disappear according to their need.

For example, on Startpage:

But once you go to a website, you can see that the Width of the URL-Bar decreases, and makes space for the **Back** Button.

And once you go back to the startpage, the **Back** Button changes to the **Forward** Button.

And when you have multiple sites in history, both of them appear.

### Simplicity

This entire theme is wrapped with **AMOLED Colors**, with **True Black**, and little to no bright colors. It is intended to be used with Systemwide Dark Mode.
And all the browser elements have been rearranged into a single bar so as to dedicate as much screen visibility as possible. 

This entire fork is supposed to be a mouse-friendly modfication to this oneliner userchrome.
Here are the list of modifications:
 - Restored site information and ETP shield
 - Brought back the caption buttons
 - Brought back the _some_ spacing in the tab bar so you could actually move the window.
